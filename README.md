[Bash script to run bacteria X subjects in parallel](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/OriC/blob/main/bactXpat.sh), which calls [this python script](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/OriC/blob/main/bactXpat.py), and <br />[then plotted](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/OriC/blob/main/circ_bactPlot.py) as in the following examples visualizing RelAb of various species in a single patient :

# Plectoneme_prediction
[Plectoneme_prediction.py](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/OriC/blob/main/Plectoneme/PlectonemeCode.py) is a reimplementation of [Plectoneme_prediction](https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Plectoneme_prediction) in python for general scientific community of 21st century {[see publication](https://elifesciences.org/articles/36557)}

in particular we use this [savitzky_golay](https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/Cookbook/SavitzkyGolay) smoothing technique rather than boxcar for smoothing
